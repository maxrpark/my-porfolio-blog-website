## Vegetarian Blog

Vegetarian Blog is my first full Django project, I had worked with Django projects before at work but this is the first one I create from scratch.

## Frontend

For the frontend structure, I only use Django templates and CSS, I did not want to use any javascript for this one.

I enjoy building the frontend, especially because of the Django template hierarchy,  {% include %}   {% extends %}  which made all the processes simple.

it was nice to have some background in frontend frameworks because it help me decide when and where to use them.

Since I use a base template many of the CSS styles are shared between the pages, but also I create specific CSS files for some of them.

## Backend

Of course, the backend is the highlight of this project and the part where I had the most fun.

Even though the project is basic, I have to think a lot about the structure and a lot of problems down the route.

I am quite happy with the result but I feel a lof backend code can be improved especially in some places where code some to be repeated.

### Cloudinary

I was so worried about serving static files and images when I deploy the project because I did not know how to do it and I thought it would take forever to figure it out.

But it turns out to be one of the easy things about this project.

I create a cloudinary account, add some specific settings to the settings.py and problem solve.

### Heroku

This is also the first application I deploy in Heroku, I also thought it was going to be way more difficult but it was very straightforward.

Have a little bit of trouble in the beginning but it was because of some silly mistake from my side.

## What is it about
Vegetarian Blog is the classic Django blog, it was the main page with some of the posts and sections, the website has a category page, tag page, and search result page.

I also have a nice sidebar with a position sticky.

### Content

I did not want to just have some boring lorem ipsum text but I did know to want to write posts for this project. So I use the content and images from my blog built with WordPress.
