# Wiki Food

Wiki Food is my first React.js app, I built it in a couple of days with my basic knowledge of React, even though there are a lot of things to improve I am very happy with the result.

I had to use all the things I know from react, the project fetches data, has a form, uses Router. It has different pages and components.

I just use one CSS file, because I did not want to bother about that. I reuse a lot of the classes so the file is actually pretty short for all these pages.

Next time I will try to use, styles components.

For this website I use [mealdb](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

## What is it about

Wiki Food is an application where you can search for different menus from all over the world.

You can take a look at the different categories, get food by country, search for a specific food or even get a random menu.

If you navigate so specific menu, you get some suggestions based on the current menu you are looking for.
