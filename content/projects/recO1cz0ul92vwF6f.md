## This is my first website 1.0.4

The main purpose of this website was to have a place where I could showcase all my projects. Basically, a website that could share with anyone interested in my work.

Of course in the future, I plan to have a nice portfolio to show my best projects, but I donâ€™t think I will create that one at least until I learn to React js or. Vue. js.

So, I did not put a lot of effort into the design of this website, I just want it to be very simple. I finish this project in one day.

It was of course it has some JavaScript functionalities, like the sidebar or modal with the contact form.
I set the form with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/).

### Dark Mode

The main feature about this website it is the dark mode, even if it is a simple website the dark mode feature makes it really special.

## What is it about

On this website, you can find all the projects I had upload. You can read a small description about each project together with a link to the website and to the repository.
