## Solar System Ts

Solar System Ts is my first React & Typescript project, It is still difficult to find my way around something in React so adding Typescript was not easy either.

Originally this was going to be pure React app but I started learning TypeScript so I decide to combine it.

Even though I was not simple I really enjoy it and after a couple of days, I started to enjoy TypeScript.

There are many things to learn and practice.

I believe most of my projects will include typescript now, but I may also do some React App without typescript since I believe it will be better to finish learning some react concepts.

For this website, I use an awesome API called [https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/en/).

## What is this app about

You can learn about the planets and moons in our solar system.
