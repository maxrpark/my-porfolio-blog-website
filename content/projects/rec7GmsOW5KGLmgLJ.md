## This is my first website 0.2

I create this website after I learned Flexbox and Grid, I wanted to practice what I learned. At that time, my biggest problem was how to create a navbar.
I built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

The javascript code I use I took from 3W School. This is from where I took the code : [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp)

## What is it about

Mainly is about the two sections I created, one Grid and another one using FlexBox.
