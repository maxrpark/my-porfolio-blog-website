## This is my first website 1.0.3

After I created myfirstwebsite1.0 I felt that all my projects kind of look the same. So I did not feel like starting anything new. Instead, I thought I will be practicing cloning a website or at least one page, My Twitter Profile Page.

I did not think at the time I started that I was going to upload this project because I thought it was going to be a simple thing.
But it turned out to be the biggest project I have done.

This project gave me the chance to practice a lot of CSS but especially JavaScript, I use all kinds of functions and methods I did not think I could use before this project.
I was so nice to realize I could use the things I have been learning and also find out how to do the things I did not know how to do yet.

## What is it about

As the title says, it is a clone page of my Twitter account. The website has 3 different layouts depending on the screen size. Most of the buttons do something and the tweets are displayed dynamically.
In fact, you can visit the website and read the tweets, in them I explain what I did.
