## Make a promise

This may look just like a very simple project and somehow it is but at the same time, it means a lot to me because this is my first full-stack project using Vue and Django.

I have been using Vue for the last 6 months at work and also in my personal projects and I have been learning Django for the last 2 months, but I never build anything combining this two.

The most difficult part was deploying it, it was overwhelming at first but once I understood what was going on, it was very simple.

##What is it about

The idea of the project is that you can post a promise or resolution you will try to accomplish and also read other people's promises.

## Frontend

### Vue

The application has only one view and two components, Cards and Form.

### GSAP

This project can also be called a [gsap](https://maxicode.pythonanywhere.com/) project since most of the animation and the idea of the frontend design and functionality rely on gsap timelines and scrollTrigger plugging.

## Backend

### Django

I build the backend of this project using Django and Django Rest Framework. Probably I could achieve the same result without using DRF but another point of this project was to practice what I know about DRF.

###PythonAnywhere

I deployed the application in pythonAnywhere you can with it out clicking on the next link.
