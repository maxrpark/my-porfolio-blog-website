## Pets Board

Pets Board is an app I created using Django, the main purpose of it was to keep learning about the fundamentals of Django.

### What is it about?

Pet Board is a website where people can create a CV or Find Me post about our beloved animals.

The idea is that you can easily create a post of a missing pet and It can be shared easily thought out social media.

Also, users can create CVs for a pet, which can be useful for people that rescue pets and need someone to adopt them.
