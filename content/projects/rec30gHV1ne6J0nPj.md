## Vegetariano En Corea

This is the third website I built using WordPress, I created it sometime before I came to live in South Korea.
Since it was my third time creating a website with WordPress, it was a lot simple and faster to build it.

As in my second WordPress site, I wanted to use a popular theme I see and learn how was it.
I did some research and after some thought, I decided to use OCEAN WP.

I really like this there and all the nice things you can do with this. Even if it is a free theme, it already has everything you could wish to customize your website.

## What is it about

Vegetariano en Corea is my personal blog. It is a place where I share my life in South Korea as a vegetarian.
I try to post every week about the things I eat, drink, or places I go.
This website is 100% in Spanish.
