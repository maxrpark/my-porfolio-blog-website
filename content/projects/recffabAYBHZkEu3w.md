## My Portfolio Blog

Working with API is one of the most fun things you can do, at least when you are new at coding. Because it is so much fun to fetch data and populate your website from an external place.

So, naturally, after I learned about APIs, I knew I will eventually want to build my own. But since at the moment I didnâ€™t know about backend, that was something I was not thinking to achieve in the short term. But then I discovered serverless functions and how helpful they can be.

So After I took my first Udemy's Serverless Functions course I decided to build this website.

## Netlify and Airtable

For this website and especially for the serverless function I use, Netlify and Airtable, to create my own API.

It is an API about this online shop call Cacteria.

## What is it about

Cacteria is an online shop, that sells the most amazing cactus in the world. The designs are all exclusive.
