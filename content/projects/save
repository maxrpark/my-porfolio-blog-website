# React and GSAP Portfolio

This is a really simple project, since I am just starting to learn to react I wanted to build something simple, that is why I thought about building something using my API the one I create with airtable and serverless functions.

I did not want to create a killer portfolio because to honest I am very happy with the one at already have, but since I wanted this one to be a little be special too, I added gsap scroll trigger and I create some parallax effect.

There are things many things that could be improve in this project, like smooth scrolling for example. But I would not do any of that for the moment.

All the content of this website is only on one page, even though I used a couple of components for practice.

Also, the nice thing about this project is that I used react-styled components.

## What is it about

A collection of all my projects with some parallax effect for the background.
