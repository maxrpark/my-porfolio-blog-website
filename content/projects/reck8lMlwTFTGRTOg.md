## Aprende Coreano Paso a Paso

This is the first website I ever created, I built it using WordPress and a theme call EDUMA.

This website is an LMS, where people can learn Korean. It was not easy to build in the beginning because I did know anything about websites or WordPress.

But after a lot of reading and making mistakes, I learned quite a lot. Not just about building WordPress websites but also about SEO.

Most of the articles of this website rank on the first page in google search and every month more than 50.000 thousand people visit it.

Besides being a website with courses and blog posts, this is an online store. Where you can buy materials to learn Korean. When I build this part of the website, it was also quite difficult because I did knot have any experience with it. But after reading the documentation, I could figure it out.
