## Why did it take this course?

I  always thought my first backend language was going to be Node.js but soon after I got my first job I realize it was going to be python, basically because that is what we use at work.

Python is very easy to read but you need to get your head around and understand how it works to be productive with it.

So, that is why I decide you take this really good course, calls  ["The Python Mega Course 2022: Build 10 Real-World Programs".](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/).


## About the course

## My thought about this course
This course was a great decision for learning python, the course covers so many different projects and examples you can implement. 
To me, this course is always going to be a reference to take a look at when I don't know or remember something because explanations are so clear.

## What I had built after this course

At the moment I have not finished building anything using python, I am learning Django now and DRF now and slowly in my free time building a full-stack application with Vue and Django.

But the best part is that now I can also collaborate every day a little bit more on the backend side of  the projects we are building at work
