## Why did it take this tutorial?

I watched this tutorial at the same time I was taking a Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann called " Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!".Â 

I like to see how other developers do and teach about the same topics because, as you know, when it comes to web development there is rarely only one way of doing things.

I found this course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) youtube channel and It is given by[Jesse Hall](https://www.codestackr.com/) who is a  Senior Developer Advocate and has a great youtube channel called codeSTACKr.

This course is just 2 hours long but it was everything you need to know to get started using SASS, even if 2 hours seems too short, SASS is in my opinion very easy to learn.

Especially if you have some understanding of CSS you can pick all the important things in a few hours and start improving from there white you use something cool.

## About the course

This tutorial is divided into yo big section, the first one where you will learn about SASS and the second one where you have the chance to code a Portfolio website with everything you had learned.

## What you will learn

- SASS

## Prerequisite

- HTML
- CSS

## My thought about this course

Awesome course to get started with SASS, Jesse Hall is a great teacher, and the way he delivers his content is great.

I believe SASS should be something everyone should know, it is very simple to learn and it can improve your code tremendously, by making it more organized, avoiding code repetition, and especially preventing you to worry about name collisions.

## What I had built after this course

These are some of the websites I build during and after this course.
