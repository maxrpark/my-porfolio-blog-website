## Why did it take this tutorial?

I watched this tutorial at the same time I was taking a Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann called " Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!", 
so I always like to see how other developers do and teach about the same topics because, you know, when it comes to web development there is rarely only one way of doing things.

I found this course on the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) youtube channel and It is given by[Jesse Hall](https://www.codestackr.com/) who is a  Senior Developer Advocate and has a great youtube channel called codeSTACKr.

This course is just 2 hours long but it was everything you need to know to get started using SASS, even if 2 hours look too short, SASS is in my opinion very easy to learn.

And if you have some understanding of CSS you can pick all the important things in a few hours and start improving from there white you use it.

## About the course

This tutorial is divided into yo big section, the first one where you will learn about SASS and the second one where you have the chance to code along with a Portfolio website everything you had learned.

## What you will learn

- SASS

## Prerequisite

HTML
CSS

## My thought about this course

Awesome course to get started with SASS, Jesse Hall is a great teacher, and the wait this all the content to be delivered is perfect.

I believe SASS just be something everyone just knows, it is very simple and I improve your code, by making it more organized, avoiding repetition, and especially preventing worries about name collisions.

This is useful especially before you learn a framework.

## What I had built after this course

These are some of the websites I build during and after this course.
