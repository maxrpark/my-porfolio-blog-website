## Why did it take this course?

I decided to take this course because I wanted to take my CSS game to the next level. I did not know that sass it can be so simple to learn and yet so powerful and useful.

Before learning SASS, I had some trouble keeping my CSS file organize, first of all, because I did not have much experience and second of all because my projects were getting bigger and bigger. So my CSS file was growing more and more.

I thought SASS could be a nice solution for this problem plus I wanted to know what more I can do with it. And finally, I believed that learning SASS was a nice skill to add to my resume.

## About the course

There are not really many courses about SASS in Udemy, to be honest, so I did know have to search all that much. But still, I am glad I took this nice course.

### Course content and Course Projects

This course is divided into 10 sections with a total of 126 lessons and a total duration of 28 hours.

During the first sections of the course, we take a look at how CSS work, what are the best practices and how to be organized. After that, we learn the fundamentals of SASS and start implementing them in the course projects.

This course has three very nice projects, using different design techniques and layouts.

The first project is calls Natours and it is a website from a travel agency, the second one is called Trillo which is a website for hotel reservations using flexbox and the last project about a real states company and this website is mostly using CSS Grid.

Even though the first project did know use flexbox or CSS Grid it was by far my favorites because I could see how SASS and folder structure work and also because this project has some very nice CSS styles tips.

## My thoughts about this course

I really liked it, I am so glad I took this course, the teacher is so friendly and explains everything in great detail. Also, he gives some very nice tips and advice that mean a lot for someone who is just starting.

Overall SASS is something very easy to learn, you can basically learn the basics in one day and then practice building something and learn from that as well.

I have found some nice SASS courses on youtube as well that I will be recommending.
