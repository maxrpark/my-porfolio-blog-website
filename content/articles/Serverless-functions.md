## Why did it take this course?
I really like to build projects and practices what I have been learning but also every time I am working on a new project I end up adding features that I don’t know how to implement first and that gives me the challenge to learn something new.

Normally all of my projects consume data from APIs, and since at some point it got difficult to find APIs providing exactly what I wanted, I thought it could be great if I can create my own.

After some time researching the best and simple way of creating an API I came across serverless functions and how useful they are.

I knew John had a course about serverless function using Netlify which I knew at some point I was going to take, but honestly, at that time I did even know what serverless functions were.

The course is simple and easy to learn, so it makes it a top 10 course and a knowledge every developer should know.

The best thing is that learning about serverless functions gives you a lot more options and tools as a developer than just building your API that is not a small thing either. 
About the course
The course is almost 8 hours long where you have the chance to use serverless functions in so many different ways.

In this course more than in anyone I had taken you to learn by doing, projects are short but go directly to the point and without even knowing you learn more things than you thought you need.

And the end of this course, you will feel like a better and more prepared web developer.

## My thought about this course

Definitely, for me, this course was a game-changer, after this course, my project became something else.

I also have the chance to start learning about HTTP methods which later lead me to put my first foot on the backend world.
