## My thought about this course

Since I like CSS, from the beginning I felt I was going to love this course. Because it was a lot of nice examples that I could use for my projects. 

But what I did not know and it was the most valuable thing I learn from the course, is that with proper knowledge about CSS and with a little imagination and creativity you can create things.

It is not just about memorizing or copying some code to use in your projects, it is about how things are built and how they work. Understanding that, there is almost no limit to what you can do.

## What I had built after this course

I have been using some of the things I learn from this course in different projects since then, for example, the buttons of the social media links have a cool effect I learn with this course.
