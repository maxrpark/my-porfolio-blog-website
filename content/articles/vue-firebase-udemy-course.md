## Why did it take this course?

Basically because I needed to learn vue for my job, two weeks after I started learning React.js I got my first job interview that lead to my first job as Web Developer.

At that time I just knew HTML&CSS and JavaScript, but the company I work for used Vue.js for most of their projects.

I never thought learning Vue, could be so easy. It is so simple to understand, so organized and the documentation is awesome.

On top of that, I took this course from Shaun and it has everything you need to know to become and Vue Ninja.

I did know about Shaun before I took this course, but after that I became a huge fan of his courses in Udemy and also of all the content on his youtube channel [The Ninja Net](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja).

## About the course

With 4.8 out of 5 stars over more than 5,500 ratings, this is one most popular and well-rated Vue courses in Udemy.

The course is 31 hours long, but the last 13 hours of the course are archived Lessons.

Vue is easy to learn but Shaun makes it even easier, every lesson is clear and well organized, every subject is explained in an effective but simple way with great examples and use cases.

Since it's a beginner's course, the first section covers the very basics of the framework to be able to start building your first application.
After that, the course covers the most important concept of the framework like data binding, routing, and of course the Composition API.

Throughout every section, you have the chance to use that knowledge in different projects.

## My thought about this course

I could not be happier with this course, from day one I started learning a lot.

Taking this course was definitely a great decision, the course is so well organized that it makes it so easy to re-watch some of the lessons when I forget how to do something.

If you want to learn Vue, this course is the way to go. [Take a look here](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-vuejs-firebase/)

Besides this course, Shawn has some amazing tutorials about Vue in his youtube challenge for example about [Vuex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGAu__J4xoc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i371QO_Rtkl26MwtiJ30P2), [Vue animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIApQjn9fvw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ghm7-iTfS9n468Kp7l9Ipu),  [Vue with typescript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gCtAuEdXTjNVE5bbMFo5OD), and more.
